# Understanding-Feature-Scaling-with-Example

In this project, we use the `StandardScaler` from the scikit-learn library to perform feature scaling. 
Feature scaling is a crucial preprocessing step in many machine learning algorithms, especially when dealing with features that have different scales.

### Why Use StandardScaler?

StandardScaler scales the features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This ensures that all features have a similar scale, preventing some features from dominating the others during model training.



- **Improved Model Performance:** Scaling can lead to better model convergence and faster training times for algorithms that are sensitive to feature scales, such as gradient-based optimization methods.
